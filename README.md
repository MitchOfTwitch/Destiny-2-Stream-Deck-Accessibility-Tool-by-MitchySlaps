<br>First of all, thank you for being here and reading this. I started this project as a means to keep my symbol callers alive during raids because well, I can't concentrate on everything all at once sometimes so this helped immensely. After sharing my initial setup on Twitter and getting very positive feedback and insight as to how this project could help make the raid more accessable to others or simply made life easier I decided to complete the whole raid. I hope you enjoy, and eyes up, Guardian.
<br>
<br>**Note** Encounters 1 and 4 are as close as I could get to resembling the encounter layout, you may have to squint really hard to see what I'm saying.

1st Continued: For the Room Callouts (below) I placed the rooms in a square in the position they are in the room to the best of my ability. I added Ligth/Dark and Pyramid/Traveler callout in here for the obelisk reader

4th/Final Encounter - Rhulk. Split into 2 pages, first the initial room where you call out which pillars to deposit on. Team callouts were L1-3 and R1-3 but feel free to change them if you wish.

Rhulk Damage Phase: Pillars are located on stream deck. Clicking them puts the location in chat and is laid out to represent you walking up the stairs. FINAL STAND will alert your team it's time for Final Stand and STAIRS will tell your team to Reset the encounter. Click GO BACK DOWN in the top left to go back to the pillar dunking phase 1 and rinse and repeat.
