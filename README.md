<br>First of all, thank you for being here and reading this. I started this project as a means to keep my symbol callers alive during raids because well, I can't concentrate on everything all at once sometimes so this helped immensely. After sharing my initial setup on Twitter and getting very positive feedback and insight as to how this project could help make the raid more accessable to others or simply made life easier I decided to complete the whole raid. I hope you enjoy, and eyes up, Guardian.
<br>
<br>**Note** Encounters 1 and 4 are as close as I could get to resembling the encounter layout, you may have to squint really hard to see what I'm saying.

**Update 3.23.2022** <br>
-- I have updated multiple options for different inputs to promote improved accessibility with the Stream Deck. <br>
-- Improved layout and looks. <br>
-- Added WEBHOOKS for direct messages to a Discord server channel **THAT YOU MUST HAVE PERMISSIONS TO ADD INTEGRATIONS TO!** <br>
----*(Make your own Discord if you have to)*<br>
-- Must copy/past webhook to every button for now (for now, I am sorry) <br>
-- 
<br>
For now, if you want to message a specific channel through webhooks you must do the following: <br>
**EDIT CHANNEL (HOVER OVER CHANNEL YOU HAVE PERMISSIONS TO)**<br>

<br>
1st Continued: For the Room Callouts (below) I placed the rooms in a square in the position they are in the room to the best of my ability. I added Ligth/Dark and Pyramid/Traveler callout in here for the obelisk reader

<br>
1st Continued: For symbols to shoot on obelisks I placed them in Obelisk Callouts

<br>
2nd Encounter/3rd Encounter: For Caretaker/The Upended I just input every symbol into two pages. Click MORE (bottom right) for the second page of symbols and line break (----)

<br>
4th/Final Encounter - Rhulk. Split into 2 pages, first the initial room where you call out which pillars to deposit on. Team callouts were L1-3 and R1-3 but feel free to change them if you wish.

<br>
Rhulk Damage Phase: Pillars are located on stream deck. Clicking them puts the location in chat and is laid out to represent you walking up the stairs. FINAL STAND will alert your team it's time for Final Stand and STAIRS will tell your team to Reset the encounter. Click GO BACK DOWN in the top left to go back to the pillar dunking phase 1 and rinse and repeat.
